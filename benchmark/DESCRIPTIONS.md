# ScyllaDB Initial Benchmark Descriptions

## Introduction

This README provides a description of the initial benchmark for ScyllaDB. It outlines the purpose, methodology, and expected outcomes of the benchmark.

## Purpose

The purpose of this benchmark is to evaluate the performance and scalability of ScyllaDB in a specific use case or scenario. It aims to measure key metrics such as throughput, latency, and resource utilization to assess the database's suitability for the given workload.

## Methodology

The benchmark will be conducted using a representative dataset and workload that closely resembles the production environment. It will involve configuring ScyllaDB with appropriate settings, loading the dataset, and executing a series of predefined operations or queries.

The benchmark will be executed on a dedicated test environment with sufficient hardware resources to ensure accurate measurements. Multiple iterations may be performed to validate the results and identify any potential performance bottlenecks.

## Expected Outcomes

The expected outcomes of this benchmark include:

- Performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and resource utilization.
- Identification of any scalability or performance limitations.
- Comparison of ScyllaDB's performance against other databases or previous versions.
- Insights into potential optimizations or tuning opportunities.
